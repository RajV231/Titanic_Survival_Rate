# Titanic_Survival_Rate
This project focuses on predicting the survival of passengers on the Titanic using various machine learning techniques. By analyzing a dataset containing passenger information such as age, gender, passenger class, and more, we aim to build a robust model that can accurately determine the likelihood of survival.
